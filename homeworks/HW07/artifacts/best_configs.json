    "method": "KMeans",
    "k": 4,
    "rationale": "KMeans (k=4) slightly outperformed Agglomerative clustering (silhouette 0.6789 vs 0.6234). Dataset-02 contains 2D structure with noise; KMeans proved more robust after proper scaling. Ward linkage was best for Agglomerative."

    "method": "KMeans",
    "k": 5,
    "rationale": "KMeans with k=5 showed highest silhouette score (0.5456) despite variable cluster densities. DBSCAN struggled with density variations typical in this dataset. PCA analysis revealed meaningful separability in 2D projection."
